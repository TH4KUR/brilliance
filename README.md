## Brilliance app

I made this app for a hackathon, to help students keep track of their results and compare it with their friends to learn how they study and organize their work and learn exponentially.

This app is completely based on students own honesty as i believe that every student should be their own manager as if anyone is forcing them to study then the results can never be upto his/her maximum potential. 

### This app is also hosted on : https://fast-shore-10116.herokuapp.com/

## Future Upgrades
- An web extension for chrome, edge etc. which will include features like anti distraction system, and will also be linked to tthe main app
- More features like motivation centre, career path recommendations and how to progress towards a particular field.
- A very modern and student friendly design in ofcourse dark theme
- The extension will also have a feature that can be enabled to see that how many times the student has been distracted in middle of online classes
